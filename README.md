# 🚀 DSA AI/ML Final Project – Fraud Detection System

An end-to-end machine learning project for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using anonymized financial data. This project covers the full ML lifecycle: from problem definition to deployment via a web interface.

---

## 📌 Project Title

**Design and Deployment of an AI-Powered Predictive System**

## 🧠 Selected Category

**Finance – Credit Card Fraud Detection**

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Can machine learning accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions based on anonymized input features—and can this system be deployed in real time to support instant decisions?

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

* **Source:** [Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
* **Instances:** 284,807 transactions
* **Features:**

  * `V1–V60` (anonymized principal components)
  * `Amount` – transaction amount
  * `Class` – 0 = Non-fraud, 1 = Fraud
* **Note:** The `Time` column was removed for optimization and privacy.

## 🔁 Project Pipeline

### ✅ Phase 1 – Dataset & Problem Definition

* Understand the problem scope
* Review dataset structure and metadata
* Define objectives

### 🧹 Phase 2 – Data Preprocessing & EDA

* Clean and scale features
* Handle imbalance (under/oversampling)
* Visualize trends and fraud patterns

### 🤖 Phase 3 – Model Training

* Test baseline models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
* Tune hyperparameters
* Evaluate with precision, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC

### 🧪 Phase 4 – Evaluation

* Compare model performance
* Address overfitting/underfitting
* Save the best model as `fraud_model.pkl`

### 🌐 Phase 5 – Deployment

* Build a minimal Flask or Next.js web interface
* Load model and accept input
* Predict fraud status and render result
* Include input validation and error handling
